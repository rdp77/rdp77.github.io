export const description = "Introducing my name is Moh Ravi Dwi Putra usually called by the name Ravi, I was born in Lamongan and grew up in the city of Surabaya. I was a figure who like information and technology activities, in this case I also often contribute to my activities such as finding defects in an application that is distributed on the internet for free and fix it. I also like things outside of information technology such as building relationships and running a business in order to grow my entrepreneurial spirit, besides that I am also happy to contribute developing human resources in my country.";
