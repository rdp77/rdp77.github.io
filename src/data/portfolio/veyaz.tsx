                A premium template designed for Laravel programmers to make their work easier, Veyaz is already
                integrated with several much-needed libraries and is certainly very helpful. For UI Veyaz uses
                Bootstrap and jQuery as a javascript library, Veyaz also supports asynchronous web applications
                (server side processing) such as AJAX and axios.
            </p>
