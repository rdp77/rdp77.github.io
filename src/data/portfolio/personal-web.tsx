            <p>
                This is my small project that aims to organize information about myself. This personal web is
                built using <b>html</b> and <b>css</b>, while for version 2 and above, it uses third-party libraries for
                css and javascript. Meanwhile, the latest version itself is a website that is currently running using a
                static site generator assisted by <b>Jekyll</b>.

                <li>- Cloudflare</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For the second version I used <b>javascript</b> framework technology, <b>Next.JS</b>, which I made this
                website faster and more interactive. this website to be faster and more interactive. This website uses
                the APP routing type from <b>Next.JS</b> so that it follows the modernization of the application, in the
                future I will also convert <b>CSS</b> to <b>Tailwind</b>.
